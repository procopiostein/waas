This repository represents the software developed in support of the We Are All Stars installation for Critical NW 2013.


Overview
---
This project consists of several modular components developed using [ROS](http://www.ros.org/wiki/), [Qt](http://qt-project.org/), and [OLA](http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Project). Leveraging ROS allows any component to be run remotely allowing for scalability and enforcing clean architecture.
